## Getting Started
- Get a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with a SD-Card 
- Visit http://mediakit.education/software.php and get a working image file

or  
- Install latest mediakit version in a fresh Raspbian enviroment via github (see installing section)

## Installing
**1.** Install berryboot (https://www.berryterminal.com/doku.php/berryboot) on a fresh sd-card. Once you start your Pi it will start an installer that reformats the SD card and downloads the operating systems files from the Internet. Install the latest Raspbian FULL version suggested by berryboot install process (i.e. Raspbian FULL 2018.11), rename the installed image to Mediakit and set memory split to 256 (see following image)

## Hints
- Screenmirroring via miracast works with Android (i.e. SmartView) and Windows devices 
- Guacamole clientless remote desktop is available via http://1.1.1.1:8080 (WLAN) or http://[LAN IP of your pi]:8080 (LAN)
- If a mediakit server is activated, it is available via http://1.1.1.1:3000 (WLAN) or http://[LAN IP of your pi]:3000 (LAN) 
- WLAN password and miracast pin are randomly generated at startup
- All changes done by user mk are deleted at startup

## Recommendation
- With an external wlan dongle wireless display (miracast) and hotspot are activated simultaneously
- Create a copy of the fresh mediakit build with the clone function of berrryboot (see https://www.berryterminal.com/doku.php/berryboot), so that you can allways restore the initial state after some experiments
- Add berryboot mediakit update image (http://images.mediakit.education/actual/Update.img) to activate updates via usb-devices 

## Contributing
Feel free to fork and optimize the code or to pull requests. We think the mediakit project is a good idea and perfect to seriously push the digitalisation of schools with a low budget beside the usual commercial ways. But therefore it needs a strong and active community. Be part of it!
